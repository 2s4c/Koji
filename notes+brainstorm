### Hardware Requirements and Costs:
Cost in US$ (not including shipping) is ==highlighted.==
#### Brain and Display - ==$36.50-61.50+== 
##### [[ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1-N4 Development Board]] - ==$11.50==
- This is the microcontroller. It's essential for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, processing sensor data, and controlling the display/[[peripherals]].
##### Screen - ==$25-50+==
- See: [[Koji's Screen]]
- This will be the robot's "face" and display for data/stats. It should be non-touch (low budget). It's necessary to confirm the exact driver chip to ensure compatibility with ESP32 libraries.

**NOTE: The screen is the largest individual chunk of the cost. I can see if I can find a different way to use a screen, such as using an old one(?), buying a used screen, or buying secondhand.**
#### Power Management - ==$0==
##### USB-C 5V Adapter (or micro-USB, depending on ESP32 board) - ==$0==
- For primary power. **MUST-HAVE**
##### power bank that my parents will probably let me use idk - ==$0?==
- hope and pray....
#### Audio Output - ==$0==
- The Zealot speaker I currently have, I don't necessarily need to buy an extra speaker.
- A short 3.5mm jack for audio output to aforementioned speaker.
#### Connectivity - ==$33-90==
##### Dupont Jumper Wires (m/f, f/f, m/m assortment) - ==$5-10==
- Definitely necessary for connecting components.
##### Small Breadboard (necessary for testing circuits) - ==$2-5==
See: [[Breadboard]].
##### Solder (a small spool will last a while) - ==$5-15==
- everything needs solder......
##### Male/Female Headers - ==$5-10==
- For soldering onto custom [[PCB]]s or [[perfboards]]. 
##### SD Card (Probs got some laying around. If not, I can use the one in my GoPro.) - ==$0-10==
Just in case I need to store information/log errors.
##### Heat Shrink Tubing (electrical tape ONLY if absolutely necessary) - ==$8-20==
- Insulates wires so I don't get electrocuted....
##### M2/M3 Screws and Nuts assortment - ==$8-20==
- For mounting stuff inside the hull so my machine isn't a maraca >,,<
#### Input and Sensing - ==$9-20==
##### ~8 Tactile Buttons - ==$5-10==
- For:
	- Brightness+/-,
	- On/Off,
	- Microphone Module (KY-038 or similar MAX9184 based module).
- I don't need 8, but extras are always good.
##### KY-038 Microphone Module (or similar) - ==$2-5==
- Small, common module used for sound detection.
##### (OPTIONAL) BH1750FVI Digital Light Sensor Module - ==$2-5==
- For light intensity detection.

*note: AliExpress will probably be my primary source for specific modules, but I should also use Amazon U.S. as a backup. I'll search for "ESP32," "4.3 inch SPI TFT LCD," "PAM8403," "SG90 Servo," "BH1750," "KY-038," and "Tactile Buttons." Bundled starter kits can also be a good way to get basic components.)*
#### ==Total Cost: $72-175==
### Software Requirements
#### Core System Requirements
##### Arduino C++.[^1]
- Using the [[ESP-IDF framework]] via [[Arduino Core]].
##### Define power states (Active, LowPower/Sleep, Off)

##### Code should be organized into logical, reusable modules to keep it clean/maintainable.
- For example: `DisplayManager`, `InputManager`, `SoundManager`, etc.
#### Display Management
##### Functionality
###### Display various "face" expressions.
- happy
- neutral
- confused
- bored
- asleep
- reacting to sound/light
###### Show current time.
- ...why are you looking at the description? it's in the name.
###### Display basic information/stats
- Wi-Fi status
- Battery level
- Sensor readings
###### Display short text messages or prompts.
- on startup: "Hello, {CusUN}!"
- on exit: "Goodbye, {CusUN}!"
###### Basic animations for speech/idle
##### Design Considerations
###### Core expressions.
as said before,
- happy
- neutral
- confused
- bored
- asleep
- reacting to sound/light
Use `enum` for `ExpressionState`
###### Transitions between screens/faces should be instant unless I feel snazzy.
###### 3 Brightness levels.
- 100%
- 65%
- 20%
###### Fonts & Sizes
- Liberation Mono 12, 18, 24
- Comfortaa 18, 24
- Lexend 48
#### Input Management
##### Functionality
###### On/Off Button
- Toggles the main power state (from `Active` to `LowPower`).
###### Brightness +/-
- Adjusts display brightness.
###### "Interaction" Button.
- 
##### Design Considerations
###### Debouncing
- Preventing one button press from being read twice.
###### Press Types
- Short/Long
- Single/Double
###### LED Feedback?
- On any button press, have an LED indicator showing if the button works.
#### Connectivity Management
##### Functionality
###### Connect to a pre-configured Wi-Fi Network 
##### Design Considerations

#### Sensor Integration
##### Functionality

##### Design Considerations

#### Actuator Control (Not needed as of C-KJ-NF-001)
##### Functionality

##### Design Considerations

#### Audio Output.
##### Functionality

##### Design Considerations

### Design Brainstorming

### Addendum/Things That Come To Mind While Designing
##### Have it be able to be controlled with [[Wooting UwU]]?
##### That would be cool i think :3
# DO NOT proceed if CAD Modeling is NF.

[^1]: Definitely my biggest hurdle.
